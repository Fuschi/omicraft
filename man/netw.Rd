\title{Retrieve Network Graph from omic Objects}
\usage{
netw(object, selected = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An \code{omic} or \code{omics} object.}
}
\value{
\itemize{
\item For an \code{omic}, a single \code{igraph} object is returned, potentially
with vertex attributes derived from the \code{taxa} slot.
\item For an \code{omics}, a \code{list} of \code{igraph} objects is returned
(one per contained \code{omic}), each enriched with node-level attributes
if available.
}
}
\description{
Retrieves the network graph stored in the \code{netw} slot of an \code{omic} object,
or from each \code{omic} object within an \code{omics}. The network graph is
an \code{igraph} object representing interactions among different taxa.

If the object has a non-empty \code{taxa} slot, all taxa information is automatically
attached as vertex attributes in the returned graph, making node-level metadata
immediately accessible for further analysis or visualization.
