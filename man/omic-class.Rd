\title{Class omic}
\description{
An S4 class designed for organizing and managing omics data in a tidy and modular fashion.
The class stores key components such as abundance matrices (raw, relative, normalized),
sample metadata, feature annotations, network structures, and community assignments.
}
\details{
This class is designed to integrate omics data — abundances, metadata, annotations, networks —
with structural consistency checks. It performs no modeling or normalization and focuses on
tidy-style manipulation and coherent data export.

\section{Slots}{

\describe{
\item{\code{abun}}{A numeric matrix of raw abundance values (samples x features).}

\item{\code{rela}}{A numeric matrix of relative abundances.}

\item{\code{norm}}{A numeric matrix of normalized abundances.}

\item{\code{meta}}{A data.frame with sample metadata.}

\item{\code{taxa}}{A data.frame with feature (e.g. taxon, gene) metadata.}

\item{\code{netw}}{An igraph object representing a network among features or samples.}

\item{\code{comm}}{A communities object (from igraph) representing community structure.}
}}

\section{Reserved Keywords}{

The \code{omic} class reserves the following keywords for internal use and method compatibility:
\code{sample_id}, \code{taxa_id}, \code{abun}, \code{rela}, \code{norm}, \code{meta}, \code{taxa}, \code{netw}, \code{comm}, \code{omic}.
Avoid using these as column names in your metadata or abundance matrices.
