\title{Filter \code{omic} or \code{omics} Objects by Sample Metadata and Abundance Fields}
\usage{
filter_meta(object, ..., .ungroup = FALSE)

\S4method{filter_meta}{omic}(object, ..., .ungroup = FALSE)

\S4method{filter_meta}{omics}(object, ..., .ungroup = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An \code{omic} or \code{omics} object. For \code{omics}, each contained
\code{omic} can be filtered according to the combined conditions, with a column
\code{omic} distinguishing them in any joined data frames.}

\item{...}{Unquoted expressions for filtering. These expressions can reference
columns in the sample metadata (\code{meta}) or any of the abundance-related fields
(\code{abun}, \code{rela}, \code{norm}). Each expression is applied sequentially, and only
samples that satisfy \strong{all} expressions are retained.}

\item{.ungroup}{Logical, default \code{FALSE}. If \code{TRUE}, remove the omic grouping
from the object at the end (i.e., drop the grouping attribute).}
}
\value{
An \code{omic} or \code{omics} object containing only the samples (and their
corresponding abundance data, if any) that satisfy all provided filter conditions.
The rest are removed. If no samples match, an object with zero samples is returned
(but the same structure otherwise).
}
\description{
Filters the samples in an \code{omic} or \code{omics} object based on user-specified
conditions provided through \code{...}. Each condition can reference columns in the
sample metadata (\code{meta}) or abundance-related fields (\code{abun}, \code{rela}, \code{norm}).
When multiple conditions are provided, they are combined using a logical AND,
meaning a sample must satisfy \strong{all} conditions to be retained.
}
\details{
This function integrates closely with \strong{tidyverse} conventions. Each expression
in \code{...} is captured and evaluated using tidy evaluation, allowing you to write
conditions similarly to \code{dplyr::filter()}. When an expression references
abundance variables (\code{abun}, \code{rela}, or \code{norm}), the function automatically
joins the sample metadata with the relevant abundance data (\code{long_abun}) before
filtering.

\strong{Multiple Conditions}:
Each condition in \code{...} is applied sequentially, narrowing down the set of
remaining samples. After processing all conditions, only those samples that
satisfied \strong{all} conditions remain.

\strong{Behavior with \code{omics}}:
\itemize{
\item The \code{omic} column in the joined data frames identifies which \code{omic} each sample
belongs to.
\item Filtering expressions can apply to metadata or abundance columns, referencing
each \code{omic}'s data.
\item Samples are filtered \strong{independently} for each \code{omic} based on the conditions.
}

\strong{Return Value}:
\itemize{
\item For an \code{omic} object, an updated \code{omic} containing only the samples that
passed all filters.
\item For a \code{omics}, an updated list of \code{omic} objects. Each \code{omic} is
subset to the remaining samples.
}

This approach provides a flexible, \code{dplyr}-like interface for complex filtering
of both sample metadata and abundance data, respecting the specified grouping context.
